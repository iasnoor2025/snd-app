- **Offline Support**: Processing of offline timesheet entries with geofence validation

### Zone Management
- **Circular Zones**: Define zones with center coordinates and radius
- **Polygon Zones**: Define complex zones with multiple coordinate points
- **Project Association**: Link zones to specific projects or sites
- **Time Restrictions**: Configure active hours and days for zones
- **Enforcement Settings**: Control entry/exit enforcement and overtime allowances

### Monitoring & Analytics

        'accuracy_threshold' => 10, // meters
        'timeout' => 30000, // milliseconds
        'max_age' => 60000, // milliseconds
    ],
    
    'geofence_zones' => [
        'default_radius' => 100, // meters
        'max_radius' => 5000, // meters
        'min_polygon_points' => 3,
        'max_polygon_points' => 20,
    ],
    
    'violation_detection' => [
        'enabled' => true,
        'severity_levels' => ['low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical'],
        'auto_resolve_timeout' => 24, // hours
    ],
];
```

### Creating a Circular Zone

```javascript
import { geofencingApi } from './services/geofencingApi';

const createCircularZone = async () => {
  const zoneData = {
    name: 'Main Office',
    description: 'Primary office location',
    type: 'circular',
    latitude: 40.7128,
    longitude: -74.0060,
    radius: 100,
    project_id: 1,
    is_active: true,
    enforce_entry: true,
    enforce_exit: true,
    monitoring_enabled: true,
    alert_on_violation: true
  };
  
  try {
    const zone = await geofencingApi.zones.create(zoneData);
    console.log('Zone created:', zone);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating zone:', error);
  }
};
```

### Validating Location

```javascript
const validateLocation = async (lat, lng, employeeId, projectId) => {
  try {
    const result = await geofencingApi.validation.validateLocation(
      lat, lng, employeeId, projectId
    );
    
    if (result.compliant) {
      console.log('Location is compliant');
    } else {
      console.log('Violations detected:', result.violations);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Validation error:', error);
  }
};
```

### Processing Offline Timesheets

```bash
# Process all offline timesheets
php artisan geofence:process-offline

# Process with specific parameters
php artisan geofence:process-offline --batch-size=50 --max-age=48 --user-id=123

# Dry run to see what would be processed
php artisan geofence:process-offline --dry-run
```

## Mobile Integration

### GPS Requirements
- Location permissions must be granted
- GPS accuracy should be within configured threshold
- Network connectivity for real-time validation

### Offline Support
- Timesheets can be created offline
- Location data is stored locally
- Sync occurs when connectivity is restored
- Geofence validation happens during sync

### Security Features
- Device fingerprinting
- Anti-spoofing measures
- Location accuracy validation
- Suspicious activity detection

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Data Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Clean up old data (keep last 30 days)
   php artisan geofence:cleanup --days=30
   
   # Clean specific data types
   php artisan geofence:cleanup --type=violations --days=90
   ```

2. **Process Offline Entries**
   ```bash
   # Schedule this to run regularly
   php artisan geofence:process-offline
   ```

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - Check database query performance
