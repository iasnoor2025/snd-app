# Migration to New Laravel 12 Application

## Overview

This document outlines the process of migrating from the old Laravel application to a fresh Laravel 12 + Inertia.js + React codebase. The migration preserves all custom functionality, including the entire `Modules/` folder, custom `app/` code, routes, resources, migrations, seeders, tests, and configuration.

## Migration Process

### 1. Backup & Clean

- Copied the following directories from the old app to a temporary location:
  - `app/` (only custom controllers/models/services)
  - `Modules/` (all 16 active modules)
  - `routes/`
  - `database/`
  - `resources/js/` & `resources/views/`
  - `tests/`
  - Configuration files: `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, etc.
- Removed non-custom files from the temporary copies:
  - Default Laravel stubs
  - `node_modules/` and `vendor/` directories
  - Generated assets and cache files

### 2. Populate New Core

- In the new Laravel 12 root, merged or overwrote the following:
  - `app/` with custom controllers/models (preserved artisan console and default services)
  - `Modules/` folder entirely (all 16 active modules)
  - `routes/` folder entirely
  - `database/migrations/` & `database/seeders/`
  - `resources/js/` & `resources/views/`
  - `tests/`
  - Merged dependencies in `composer.json` and `package.json`

### 3. Install & Configure Packages

- Ran `composer install` to pull in all required PHP packages:
  - nwidart/laravel-modules (v12.0)
  - inertiajs/inertia-laravel
  - spatie/laravel-permission
  - spatie/laravel-medialibrary
  - spatie/laravel-activitylog
  - laravel/sanctum
  - Other required packages
- Ran `npm install && npm run dev` to rebuild JS assets and Tailwind/ShadCN UI

### 4. ModuleServiceProvider & Autoload

- Verified each module's ServiceProvider (e.g., `Modules/<Name>/Providers/<Name>ServiceProvider.php`) properly loads:
  - Migrations: `$this->loadMigrationsFrom(module_path('<Name>','Database/Migrations'))`
  - Routes: `$this->loadRoutesFrom(module_path('<Name>','Routes/web.php'))`
  - Views, translations, and configurations
  - Observers, events, jobs, and factories
- Ran `composer dump-autoload` and `php artisan module:refresh` to regenerate module maps

### 5. Database & Migrations

- Ran `php artisan migrate` to build the schema
- Ensured migrations were in the correct module folders and timestamp order

### 6. Frontend Build & Layout

- Ran `npm run dev` to build frontend assets
- Confirmed Tailwind config's `content` array includes paths under `Modules/**/resources/js` and `resources/js`
- Verified Vite configuration properly aliases module paths

### 7. Authentication & Permissions

- Verified Sanctum + Spatie Permission setup
- Ran `php artisan db:seed` to seed roles/permissions
- Tested login, registration, and permission-protected module routes

### 8. Testing

- Ran `php artisan test` to execute PHP Unit tests
- Ran JavaScript test suite
- Fixed broken imports, namespaces, and failing assertions

### 9. Smoke Test

- Manually navigated to each module's index page:
  - `/hr/employees`
  - `/hr/leaves`
  - `/hr/timesheets`
  - `/hr/payroll`
  - `/projects`
  - `/rentals`
  - `/equipment`
  - `/settings`
  - `/notifications`
  - `/reports`
  - `/localization`
  - `/audit`
- Confirmed pages loaded without errors, UI was styled correctly, and CRUD actions worked

## Commands Run

```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Refresh module registration
php artisan module:refresh

# Clear caches
php artisan optimize:clear

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Seed the database
php artisan db:seed

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Build frontend assets
npm run dev

# Run tests
php artisan test
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Module Registration**: Verified all 16 modules are registered and active in `modules_statuses.json`
2. **Database Schema**: Confirmed all tables were created correctly
3. **Frontend Assets**: Verified CSS and JavaScript compiled without errors
4. **Authentication**: Tested login, registration, and password reset
5. **Authorization**: Verified role-based access control for different user types
6. **Module Functionality**: Tested CRUD operations in each module
7. **API Endpoints**: Verified API routes are accessible and return correct responses
8. **Internationalization**: Confirmed i18n support works across the application

## Final Status

The migration to the new Laravel 12 + Inertia.js + React application has been completed successfully. All 16 modules are functioning as expected with their full feature set preserved. The application maintains the same modular architecture, namespacing, and functionality as the original while benefiting from the improvements in Laravel 12 and the latest frontend technologies.
